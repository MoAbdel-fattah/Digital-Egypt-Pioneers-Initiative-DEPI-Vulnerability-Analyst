## 1. Security Engagement Summary

### Overview
This report documents the findings of the "Password Strength" vulnerability challenge in the Juice Shop application. The purpose of the assessment was to identify and exploit weaknesses in the password policy, specifically targeting the ease with which weak passwords can be brute-forced, thus exposing the application to unauthorized access.

### Scope
The assessment focused on the Juice Shop authentication mechanism, particularly targeting the login functionality for the administrator's account.

### Methodology
- **Tools Used**:  
  - **Web Browser**: For interacting with the login page and analyzing the HTML source code.  
  - **Burp Suite**: To intercept login requests and automate brute-force attacks on the administrator's password.

### Key Findings
- The administrator’s account was protected by a weak password (`admin123`), making it susceptible to brute-force attacks.
- The weak password policy allowed the use of common and easily guessable passwords.

### Recommendations
- Implement strong password policies that require a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Rate-limit login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts.

## 2. Significant Vulnerabilities Summary

### Vulnerability List
1. **Weak Password Policy**  
   - **Risk Rating**: High  
   - **Impact**: Unauthorized access to administrator-level privileges.

2. **Lack of Rate-Limiting for Login Attempts**  
   - **Risk Rating**: Medium  
   - **Impact**: Increased susceptibility to brute-force attacks.

### Impact
- A successful brute-force attack could lead to full administrative access, enabling attackers to modify sensitive data, disable critical security controls, or launch further attacks on other users.

## 3. Significant Vulnerabilities Detail

### 3.1 Vulnerability: Weak Password Policy
- **Description**:  
  The application allowed the use of a weak password (`admin123`) for the administrator account. This password was part of a commonly used password list, making it highly vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
  
- **Proof of Concept**:  
  A brute-force attack was successfully carried out using Burp Suite's Intruder module, testing common passwords against the administrator’s email. The password `admin123` was found and used to gain unauthorized access.

- **Remediation Strategy**:  
  Implement stronger password policies that enforce password complexity, length, and password expiration. Encourage the use of password managers for secure and complex passwords.

- **Business Impact**:  
  This vulnerability, if exploited, could result in the complete takeover of the application, leading to potential data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage.

### 3.2 Vulnerability: Lack of Rate-Limiting for Login Attempts
- **Description**:  
  The login interface did not enforce any rate-limiting controls, allowing unlimited attempts to guess the password. This lack of protection exacerbates the risk of brute-force attacks.
  
- **Remediation Strategy**:  
  Introduce rate-limiting for login attempts and lock accounts temporarily after a specified number of failed login attempts. Consider integrating CAPTCHA or multi-factor authentication.

- **Business Impact**:  
  Without rate-limiting, the application is left open to continuous brute-force attacks, significantly increasing the risk of a security breach.

## 4. Security Analysis Methodology

### Tools and Techniques
- **Web Browser**: Used to identify the administrator's email address by inspecting the website’s source code.
- **Burp Suite**: Used for intercepting HTTP requests and performing the brute-force attack on the login page.

### Methodology
1. **Identifying Administrator's Email**:  
   Searched through the website’s source code and found the administrator’s email (`admin@juice-sh.op`) in HTML comments.
   
2. **Intercepting Login Request**:  
   Used Burp Suite to intercept the login request while attempting to log in with a random password.

3. **Brute-Force Setup**:  
   Configured Burp Suite’s Intruder tool with a wordlist of common passwords and replaced the password field with placeholders to iterate through each password.

4. **Brute-Force Execution**:  
   Monitored responses for success, confirming the password `admin123`.

### Evidence
- Screenshots of the email discovery, brute-force setup, and successful brute-force attack are provided above for validation.

### Limitations
- The assessment focused solely on the administrator’s password and login mechanism; other potential vulnerabilities in the Juice Shop application were not assessed.

## Additional Sections

### Executive Summary
This vulnerability assessment on Juice Shop revealed significant weaknesses in the password policy and the absence of rate-limiting mechanisms. Exploiting these vulnerabilities allowed for unauthorized access to the administrator's account, emphasizing the need for stronger password enforcement, rate-limiting, and multi-factor authentication.

### Appendix
- Full logs from Burp Suite and the password wordlist used for brute-forcing can be provided upon request.
